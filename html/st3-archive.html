        <h3 class="verticalspace">Objectives</h3>
        <ul class="listspace">
            <li>
                Use js events to create interactive/experiential design. The goal is to get your audience to interact with your interface and learn more about you through a collection of images that represent a personal archive</li>

                <li><em>Option: Scan five random objects that you brought with you to class and create
a visual strategy to connect all objects in a visually appealing interface</em></li>

            <li>When you are designing interactivity, ask yourself what you would expect if you were using this site. Would the buttons highlight when clicked? Would you want to see hover feedback (but remember that touch devices, such as smartphones and
                tablets do not have hover states)? What kind of response/behavior would you expect from the user interaction? And what would really irriate you? What do you want to make sure doesnâ€™t happen? </li>
                  <li>For example, when the user clicks an image, a new div could load over the interface with text about the object (or do something much more creative, engaging and interesting). You are designing the interface and the experience. <em>Have fun</em></li>
            <li>You, as the maker, must define every aspect and every <br> detail of the UI (User Interface), IxD (Interaction Design) and UX (User Experience)</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 class="verticalspace">File structure</h3>
        <ul class="listspace">
          <li><em>Note: Use the <a href="http://www.redrocketmedia.com/des157/downloads/js-domcontent.zip">template files</a> that include the DOMContentLoader event listener</em></li>
            <li>Create a folder called &quot;studio3&quot; inside your main web folder </li>
        </ul>
        <h3 class="verticalspace"><strong>index.html</strong>, <strong>style.css</strong>, and <strong>script.js </strong>(inside the studio3 folder)</h3>
        <ul class="listspace">
            <li>Sketch on paper first!</li>
            <li><em>Recommended: After your paper sketch, create a digital sketch in PS, AI or Sketch</em></li>
            <li>Create a visual strategy to present all images in a visually appealing interface</li>
            <li>Consider building the interface in a way that intrigues visitors, and also is visually cohesive</li>
            <li>Use js to define behavior. Code events such as mouseover, mouseout <br />and click to change css <em>(optionally including <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_animations.asp">animations</a>, <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_transitions.asp">transitions</a> and <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css3_pr_transform.asp">transforms</a>)</em></li>
            <li>Add a &lt;footer&gt; that includes an html validation link and a css validation link:</li>
            <li class="inner">
                &lt;a href="https://validator.w3.org/check?uri=referer"&gt;Valid HTML 5&lt;/a&gt;</li>
            <li class="inner">
                &lt;a href="https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/check/referer"&gt;Valid CSS&lt;/a&gt;</li>
            <li class="inner">Example:
                <a href="https://validator.w3.org/check?uri=referer" target="_blank">valid html</a> | <a href="https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/check/referer" target="_blank">valid css</a>
                <li style="margin-top:15px;"><em>Note: The validation links will not work until the page is uploaded</em></li>
                <li>Use external css and external js. Save files as <em>index.html</em>, <em>style.css</em>, <em>script.js</em>, <br> in the <em>studio3</em> folder (keep the html, css and js on the main level of the <em>studio3</em> folder) </li>
                <li>Update the portal to link to studio 3</li>

        </ul>
        <h3 class="verticalspace"> blog.html</h3>

        <ul class="listspace">
            <li>Add a blog entry (including header, subheader, and date) to your blog, that includes a screen capture of your final design and an explanation of how you connected your various visual elements in the user interface with the interactive/experiential
                design. List three aspect about your solution that you think support effective and interesting interface design</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 class="verticalspace">Upload</h3>
        <ul class="listspace">
            <li>Make sure your code is well formatted (beautified) before uploading</li>
            <li>Submit the URL for this studio to the Canvas Assignment</li>
            <li>Commit all changes to your github repository (studio2 folder, updated portal and updated blog)</li>
            <li>Submit the URL for this studio to the Canvas Assignment</li>
